This sample demonstrates how to set up Node.js REST API service using OAuth2 protocol. Then this service is integrated with Azure Active Directory for API protection.  
Xamarin mobile client is used to test access to the service.

REST API service is built using Restify and MongoDB with the following features:
* A Node.js server running a REST API interface with JSON using MongoDB as persistent storage.
* REST APIs leveraging OAuth2 API protection for endpoints using Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

Node.js code is based on [WebAPI-Bearer-NodeJS](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/WebAPI-Bearer-NodeJS) sample.
